# Deepfake Detection using CNN, ResNet50, and InceptionV3

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to detect **deepfake** and **real** images using multiple deep learning architectures.  
With the rapid growth of synthetic media generation techniques, especially deepfakes, there is a growing need for automated tools to identify manipulated content.  

In this project:
- We train and evaluate **three main models**:
  - A **Custom CNN (TinyVGG-style)**
  - **ResNet50**
  - **InceptionV3**
- The models are trained on the [Deepfake and Real Images Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images).
- The dataset is split into **Training**, **Validation**, and **Test** sets.
- The models are evaluated using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrices.
